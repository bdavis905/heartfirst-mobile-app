I think we should come up with a more elegant design, and it should open on the same side as the hamburger menu, not the opposite side.  Can you place guidelines at the very top, the scanning functionality in the middle, and the Greens tracker at the bottom?

But we need to fix the progress ring. When it has zero servings, it's showing a significant amount of green. It needs to be completely empty, no green, when it's on zero.
